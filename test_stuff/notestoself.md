-- edit pages (prompts and users) need a back button
-- css in user's profile (user/show.ejs)
-- css in user's profile edit (center the form)... maybe the delete button should go here?
-- style the notice box on prompt show page better... is there a way to reference the post?
-- clean up css (consolidate similar elements, give ids and classes better names)


-- timestamps
-- points? (and where will this go in terms of css?)
