SMALL THINGS

-- categorize prompts by theme
-- style the notice box on prompt show page better... is there a way to reference the post?
-- clean up css (consolidate similar elements, give ids and classes better names)


-- timestamps
-- points? (and where will this go in terms of css?)




DONE
-- formatting... if a user presses enter, can i make a new paragraph form?
-- paginate pages
-- css in user's profile (user/show.ejs)... buttons at top. do something about the prompts display
-- css in user's profile edit (center the form)... maybe the delete button should go here?
-- edit pages (prompts and users) need a back button (prompt clickable... takes back to actual prompt, user name clickable, takes back to profile)
